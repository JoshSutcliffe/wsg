## Approach
I felt that the databases were the primary challenge in this excercise, so I spent time planning my database. After this, I linked them together and tested that they worked the way that I wanted to.

I then focused on routing and testing these links to ensure that they worked. Creating the login, create an account and logout functionalities were then worked on. Finally, adding stadiums and being able to edit them was the final piece of functionality. 

I then used Materialise as the CSS framework and used this to style all of my pages, adding in some of the materialize.js tools.

## Features to Add
- Multiple pictures for stadiums (create fourth table in database)
- View stadiums posted by individual users
- Sort by functionality on home page
- Comments section on show page
